    nqueens.cpp

    author: Anthony Lupica <ar127@uakron.edu>
    purpose: solve the NQueens problem using the backtracking algorithm for some .csv input 
             representing a chessboard of size N x N. If a solution is found for N queens, 
             a .csv solution is produced. Otherwise, no solution is displayed.
    
    Information: This program was built and tested in an Ubuntu shell with CMake. 

                 Assumptions made:

                 * Assumes the name of the input file is "input.csv" and is present in the build 
                   directory.
                 * Does not validate against the occurance of non-square input,
                   or input that does not adhere to strictly comma-separated 0's and 1's.
                   If these inputs are made, infinite recursion may arise.
                 * One initial queen (1) must be present in some starting position as a given condition.
                   Future versions may add functionality for the option to omit an initial queen.
    
    Implementation:

                 This implementation uses four std::unordered_sets to track row/column and positive/negative 
                 diagonal information for each queen. These sets are used for constant time lookup
                 for the validity of placing a queen.

/* 
    pre: Nqueens() is a recursive backtracking algorithm that uses rows as the recursion parameter (incrementing the row for each call).
         Row begins at 0, and increments until N (The dimensions of the board).
         This implementation requires a number of things to be true, namely a 2D vector declared in QueenPos::, which consists 
         entirely of 0's (not queens) and a single 1 (representing a *mandatory* given initial queen). These values must also be
         arranged in a square, analagous to a chess board. 
    post: The recursive solution expands out the *frontier in depth-first fashion. If a point is reached where a queen cannot be 
          placed safely, each stack frame is "backtracked" until a valid queen can be placed with which to proceed.
          The solution, if possible for the input, will be indicated by returning a 1 to the original caller. Otherwise, 0 is returned.
