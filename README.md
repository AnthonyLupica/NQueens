# NQueens
Artificial Intelligence: Project 1

Problem Description: The N-queens is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NxN chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. Wiki has detailed description of the problem and the history of the problem. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle

The objective of this project is to implement **backtracking algorithm** to solve the N-queens problem. To make your project more interesting, a constraint (the 1st Queen's position) will be specified. You are to solve the problem and obtain a feasible solution that is conforming to the constraint. No need to find all feasible solutions. Report "No solution" if there is no compatible solution.

Specific requirements:

1. Your program takes in an input file (.csv file) that specifies the chessboard with the 1st Queen's position. 

2. Your program solves N-queens with specified position for the 1st Queen.

3. Your program will save the solution to a .csv file; it should have the same format as the input file. 

4. Download my grading program & grade your solutions for different Ns. For example, N=4, 8, 16, 20.

Submission instructions:
Submit an electronic copy of the program using project1 dropbox at Brightplace. You are required to zip your submission inside an archive. Follow these steps:

1. Create a folder named zippy_1 (but use your name/uanetID). 
2. Place just the source file(s) inside the folder.
3. Right-click on the folder and choose Send To... Compressed Folder (or use some other Zip utility to archive the entire folder). I think one file should be sufficient for this project.
4. Drop this single zipped file in your dropbox at Brightplace.
Be sure to submit your working solution before the due date! Do not submit non-working programs. The submission time will be used to assess late penalties.
